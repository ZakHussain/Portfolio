				<h2>Personal Summary</h2>
				<p>I am looking for opportunities to develop interdisciplinary skills to research and solve a myriad of diverse, global problems. I lead with a strong sense of curiosity, and often find myself searching for the most efficient, team-based approach to challenges.</p>
				<p>I would like my next role to challenge and further hone my strengths - analyzing and identifying shortcomings; developing strong team-relationships; creativity; and effectively, as well as efficiently executing strategies to achieve goals.</p>
				<p>Learning from human history and experiences is the foundation in everything I do. We all experience a story unique to ourselves; within every story, is a lesson to be learned. I believe linking the mistakes of the past is key to understanding the present, and will allow us to build a better future.</p>
